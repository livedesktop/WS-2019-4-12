The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MZ70MD95T2X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"UNO with Buddies Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10626.13879968343694595.1044f923-dad6-4d92-a069-28c927349c3a.a4aac5f7-d2d3-4db5-af15-e017f4e491bb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20265.13879968343694595.1044f923-dad6-4d92-a069-28c927349c3a.58e37da1-5104-4d32-a188-d34b99fef295","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35898AvengersMultiplayerG.UNOwithBuddiesFree_y3pqx5k95c68p"],"ContentIds":["01e44ff8-ec50-1808-c4ea-4f8e501dc57f","d4176735-2d5a-534d-726f-5da955cc5077"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"UNO with Buddies: Fast Fun Card Game for Everyone!

Using a phased approach, we're rolling out something we're proud to share with you: introducing the Intel® Graphics Command Center.\r\n\r\nYou told us how confusing ‘tongue twister’ features like tessellation and anisotropic filtering can be to understand, so we created a robust help option tailored to simplifying it all.

We'll be introducing many more features and functions in later phases and will keep the improvements coming, to give you the best possible experience we can.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Aside from the legend about the famous Lock Ness, there are numerous stories all around the world about lakes with a huge number of accidents and drownings.

Some of those lakes were supposedly built on a place where many years ago was an actual cemetery.\r\n\r\nOthers hid bodies of some murdered people or people that drawn in the lake but they didn't complete their missions in life so their ghosts take revenge into drowning other people and so on.

your Windows product key with ShowKeyPlus.\r\nYour product key depends on the type of Windows version you bought:\r\n\r\n• If you bought Windows from an authorized retailer, the product key will only show as the Installed key. This applies to OEM System Builder keys as well.\r\n\r\n• If you upgraded Windows, the Original key will be the key installed prior to the upgrade.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKQCB","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"The Globe and Mail's Globe2Go ePaper service","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42049.9007199266537251.e70bfc85-2035-4571-b976-1f1b82816481.c9123c7f-7d6f-4140-93b4-a88e1bf85e68","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#CE271E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.7743.9007199266537251.c9813dd7-3ec1-4afa-8a9c-827d7335a12e.a3819158-a88e-4b3e-bc0e-ce1952abd2ba","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#CE271E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DBD8A75E.TheGlobeandMailsGlobe2GoePaperservice_a4c7yg1c8yazj"],"ContentIds":["489a38af-42c9-0c3f-7cfb-c54058bd64ee","f8b0d059-8716-445f-30fc-e47eaceef750"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"* The Globe and Mail’s full colour ePaper \r\n\r\nGet the newly re-designed product in full colour and as an exact replica of the printed newspaper.

An audio player with large simplified buttons fro ease of use.\r\n\r\nSuitable for live events such as:\r\nsports events, theatre, classrooms, workout classes (aerobics, step, spinning, Zumba, etc.), dance classes, and parties.\r\n\r\nThe problem:\r\nMy softball team really liked how the Toronto Blue Jays players each have a theme song that played when they are up to bat. We wanted to do the same thing. Unfortunately, we found that using an MP3 player or iPhone for this purpose was very awkward. We would often start the wrong song or have a hard time seeing the song titles. It was also a chore to \"train\" teammates to be the \"D.J.\" \r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\nThis app solves this problem. Each of the buttons is large and easy to see. You can pick the correct song each time, no matter how big your fingers are. Since the songs are named and organized in the filesystem, not the app, there is no data entry or creating of playlists required. The fades are very professional.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS STORE EXCLUSIVE","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRB6S","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"ASUS GIFTBOX","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45900.9007199266549051.d4451359-8719-4961-9dc7-c71c3b8c9adf.4efbdeb2-9a85-4471-96a5-a88786883ea4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21363.9007199266549051.07f98815-713f-4f14-bdd9-daae0fc2b9d0.0874b9ec-e2be-4e64-b39c-04e2963f52c7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59038.9007199266549051.f9d8f1fd-1279-4ae2-8999-df9896962681.1a5a9804-707e-4e17-bf20-929eec6a4a7f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26015.9007199266549051.00d169d9-a316-4286-8fa6-538001b2fb7e.d2547a37-e241-45f9-bc22-9f37849f801f","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16105.9007199266549051.c6abf41c-ca6f-409c-bfd8-fd2c80fde876.63ca8cd8-6895-43b8-9f6b-800ddb4e7f0c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.943.9007199266549051.c2acfd6f-ed0d-4f9b-88f5-d0ab4cdf19a7.2202e732-5fe0-4742-bca7-bb03e6205433","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["B9ECED6F.ASUSGIFTBOX_qmba6cd70vzyy"],"ContentIds":["499b82a5-2dfc-696f-1338-3d49e56614e2","ad830ffe-4965-0217-a1ee-fda78059978f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Discount + Free gift + Best tool!\r\nASUS GIFTBOX is awesome!\r\n\r\nASUS GIFTBOX is a portal that not only gives you access to popular apps, special offers but also provides you the easy set-up, personalization and safer way to enhance your ASUS PCs.\r\n\r\nASUS GIFTBOX constantly introduces new deals on the best apps, and it even offers special discounts and trials for premium apps like Dropbox, Polaris and WPS.

If there’s one thing we know how to do is how to have terrific garage sales! There is a saying that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure which we believe is very true. So, today we are organizing a neighborhood Garage Sale. This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast.

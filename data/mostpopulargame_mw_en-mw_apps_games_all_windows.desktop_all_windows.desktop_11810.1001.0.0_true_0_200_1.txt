It's for babies, toddlers, or anyone who benefits from learning about shapes, patterns, matching, and early motor skills.  The default mode is to connect two shapes by tapping one and then the matching one. When two shapes are connected, a light tone is played, and when all the shapes on the screen are connected, a fun WIN sound is played. Ads are included to keep the game free, and for a small fee they can be removed... but if you like the game, it would be great if you could click an ad every now and then.\r\n\r\nSettings are accessed through the Windows 8 Settings interface, making it less likely for your little one to need to ask you for help if they get into it.  You can set up the game to:\r\n\r\n* Tap, drag a line, or draw a line to connect shapes. Tapping works great for children under 2 years old.\r\n\r\n* Match either 2, 3, 4, or a random number (between 2, 3, and 4) of shapes on the screen.\r\n\r\n* Choose between connecting 2-dimensional shapes, 3-dimensional shapes, or 3-dimensional outlines.\r\n\r\n* Race - Play 5 games with the current settings. The total time is shown, and if the previous best time is beat, the winner can save their name. This mode ended up being surprisingly fun for parents and older siblings.\r\n\r\n* Enable or disable sounds.\r\n\r\nThis game is for the best people around, and I hope you and your child enjoy it as much as my young testers did. Thanks for trying it out, let me know if there are any problems, and if you like it please give it a positive rating.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Statement: This application does not collect any of your personal information.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9TT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pocket Sheep","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49264.9007199266252220.6a4b33b3-73a2-43ab-9635-a2df2b02bb92.ad98c9d7-26d6-4ece-83c9-2d71f30b2a8c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37070.9007199266252220.6397b7ee-cdc4-4bbc-964c-4f288ba682b5.8389dc38-ae1a-4b0e-8439-d25241df1ac3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12634.9007199266252220.6c2e8a97-d38e-40b6-bbec-d3fea3ac9f74.8a1a864e-891f-4a74-9095-b9667b681156","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50624.9007199266252220.ce7167c8-9990-4599-bcbf-832b5b30c9f2.08c91ead-bb13-4a05-b0b9-b58aad0d0dc1","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22198.9007199266252220.203fa409-8f27-4b03-8895-0ad4cdc1bf9d.0ca6a904-bf0f-4190-be14-23a1831edba9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49645.9007199266252220.bf4c7ce6-1663-43e5-b6a7-410ff2a34f72.796b03da-d204-4b77-91b7-7c63146ecb3b","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#0d0e54","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99⁺","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NoBrakesGames.30106E3AE3D9C_zqh638gbb1trm"],"ContentIds":["75f092f8-265f-27c4-f14a-7ee8ddfc02e7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"They are tiny.

This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJBWS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual City 2: Paradise Resort HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.65344.9007199266251261.25fe8f43-656a-456f-a42d-5f15c59a83d4.b78dfc24-f277-477c-aaef-2aab10556431","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49599.9007199266251261.43e1d614-0cbd-424a-8e79-d0c19e082a8c.e670af9f-0e9a-462e-9f78-2c19bdf69c1b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33019.9007199266251261.d927e5a7-a789-4afb-82d7-ac6fae0c17b1.f06cb643-bfaa-44e3-ae36-5c4877d18259","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10795.9007199266251261.641625ce-ec8b-457f-82a1-cf16a47ad192.2db001d4-95fb-4067-8554-b00801931e05","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14065.9007199266251261.fe8212b5-b9ca-4837-afcb-aea48ccc2ae6.2874c416-1c99-430a-a1ae-30540eac7ddb","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.36476.9007199266251261.5257d7f6-3b50-4a13-8cac-b0c1a4137f36.9dcda65f-13b2-424e-9f1d-9e0f77cd0548","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.VirtualCity2ParadiseResort_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["5264bd9b-6672-8ad9-e0cc-8c5d7876da7b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LONG-AWAITED SEQUEL TO VIRTUAL CITY IS FINALLY HERE! \r\nNew buildings, new product chains, new challenges!

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNZN1PFQQ5D","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Craft Subway Surf","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26876.13733275988066525.a694e87a-7690-4a66-b69f-45d9b1f0c750.b4ceb6d0-feb5-4df4-825c-b2bd68ef78d5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10573.13733275988066525.a694e87a-7690-4a66-b69f-45d9b1f0c750.8530a976-9bf8-4a70-b357-40d5c9aaa682","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35898AvengersMultiplayerG.CraftSubwaySurf_y3pqx5k95c68p"],"ContentIds":["413eb80a-da38-2a60-436b-1d5491f74ef6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Craft Subway Surf is minecraft endless runner game in 3D block world of famous game Minecraft!

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill! Face the challenge, become the best chess player!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

You are the on-duty ambulance emergency driver who needs to attend to the emergency call on the situation and take injured people to hospital ER for medical treatment. The lives of those people depend on you so you need to reach the accident scene and save lives. Drive fast and safe to transport them to a hospital emergency room while the ambulance doctor provides first aid treatment on the way. Driving, parking and transporting are all part of your duties as an ambulance rescue driver. Don’t forget to turn the ambulance sirens on so that people make way for you to be able to successfully complete your rescue mission.\r\n\r\nDriving an ambulance is not an easy task as you always have to drive safe and also have to reach the hospital in time. The situation is serious and people are injured. Make sure you drive straight and don’t crash into buildings as that will stop you from reaching the hospital in time and can also be fatal for the patients.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH2WKLX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Preschool ABC Number and Letter Puzzle Games - teaches kids the alphabet and counting","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.50679.13510798884993283.83145160-c046-4b17-a343-a852f1a62e65.10f74798-c1aa-47c9-bd2b-e77ad4ca17fe","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6181.13510798884993283.828dd480-c465-4f3c-9974-25494092e53f.b5d170ce-3500-4bca-b644-ec647cd8533b","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46977.13510798884993283.cf54a7c8-8f28-4d88-8218-9f97b0cc4807.764e8ebb-a805-4695-91ea-16700c40d4c9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13787.13510798884993283.de3e2180-31a6-4d09-9a36-7cbe7bd71645.b472843e-e774-474e-8a88-deb5d16408f0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.61224.13510798884993283.d68345e6-fdfa-4446-bc62-a131d178fabf.c007f7f9-685d-49cf-8991-7dfbb7a6505a","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55261.13510798884993283.c26411d9-e6bf-45c3-bec6-81de34561421.54173e13-d1d1-4ed4-a786-01ea2b9a45bf","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11729.13510798884993283.f3397908-7b37-46cf-9353-ccf44ce6592e.a22fa7e6-2f9f-4acb-8f92-be47686bb6d4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57922.13510798884993283.c546f123-b9fb-4f99-adca-fd2f3c6d8af3.ba94d17a-a18e-4737-a63a-7e9c540ae29b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5418.13510798884993283.536f1772-cbce-455d-a81c-b314b54a5178.4fd403ab-ff7e-4073-b437-0f38ebe7d88c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["EspacePtyLtd.PreschoolABCNumberandLetterPuzzleGame_38khqxevzecjw"],"ContentIds":["d471cdf1-991a-55f6-7608-0eb8975b690a","b5e2c618-9609-482b-df81-de3fbf5b5bfc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A variety of educational and fun puzzle style games that teach young children the alphabet, counting, math and simple words in a fun and intuitive way.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

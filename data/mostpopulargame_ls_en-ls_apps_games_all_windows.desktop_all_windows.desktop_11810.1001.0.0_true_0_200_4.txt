Colors lets toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize colors and name them in ways that are really fun.\r\n\r\nThe game is from Intellijoy. We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVQKB35TDN7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Connect Bubbles Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59281.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.ce1ec240-679d-49ef-aac9-bd3ba744f2ce","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.248.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.f1916016-1c39-4e2d-9128-c83f7b54323b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28772.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.0e6e4073-16e6-4847-9949-5319a099ac1a","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GSoftTeam.ConnectBubblesClassic_65ca9qnt7cjzg"],"ContentIds":["b5f01df0-7189-4bdb-9fc6-d6d04a3caeb0","46299dca-80db-07c9-fb55-03c08768b98b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From the makers of Connect Bubbles, a new game filled with challenges and fun!

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N1X557D9N97","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Billiards.Olympics","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48369.13967839573337690.40ea0717-6112-4c60-941d-391e283bd8a2.2a50fc10-b90d-479e-947c-b78e16205334","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58310.13967839573337690.e3ba96e6-0423-463b-9e3e-c40191fcf1b1.198961af-558b-4f46-bacd-9eeb55b82b34","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55247.13967839573337690.1a083976-2e33-453c-a5b0-35371b2b212c.79e218b2-b7d4-49a1-89bf-a0befa9cc40e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57044.13967839573337690.05e49e68-aaea-4177-a4b5-fdcabebd23b7.9480202e-aa10-42be-a7da-d91335578a3f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49139.13967839573337690.89580399-e39c-4907-b785-3f32359475c1.70771810-ef35-4157-b1b7-a55c580a3eb1","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["45515SkyLineGames.Billiards.Olympics_zrw4chdf0m07a"],"ContentIds":["51051b51-77d9-c9ca-0cd8-be3a0be66217","c0088524-a479-c075-7b8a-8f5cabb382a7","bf04a408-cf17-a552-8e83-efdfba49aea0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Billiard.Olympics is a Windows store and a Windows phone store application where you play the very popular 8 ball billiard game.

legions of enemies attack from all sides. The powerful domain of the kingdom attracts enemies of all kinds, each more dangerous and devastating to the realm's armies than the last. \r\n\r\nThe king's reign has been threatened, and his personal sorcerer believes he has come up with a way to pull on ancient magic to ensure protection of castle and king, but something terrible and unexpected occurred during the spell and now a dark and mysterious force now looms large over the lands.

The spell was complete. The Druid Warlord of legend was born, and he was ready to go to war for the people of Komkaria. The Warlord lurched upright, and the glint of a candlelight flashed off his blade as it swung viciously through the air. \"Traitor!\" the Warlord growled. As the blade found its mark, and the blood gurgled up in the throat of the magician, he realized the one fatal flaw in his spell...\r\n\r\nGive it Your Best Shot...\r\nFight your way against dozens of ultimate foes as you guard the mighty powers of this impressive temple of war. The forceful soul of the guardian spirit is potent within these walls, but whose side does he champion?

The coins are also used to restore lives and buy rum for the sailors in order to open new episodes.\r\nCollect treasures, compete with your friends and become a real pirate!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PD900PH8MLQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mad Gunz","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56712.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.77c3b005-6a1c-40bb-ad8e-108bcdf927b1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18474.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.70d25c14-6647-445c-af4e-8daf3fd47c49","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37856.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.9c92cd84-3021-41ed-90aa-834580edd6a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6917.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.3d558704-222f-4e2e-8cf1-93c177adaf19","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7051.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.ee6b0536-b819-4b0f-be6f-29bc24ae6c8d","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55332.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.94f0c133-15d9-4254-8a4a-fc160a287c20","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55148.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.873e205e-738b-46d5-bd6c-d6d71ee0c3e7","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42605.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.ee417b56-5e67-48e7-ac94-04779ea3b403","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27585.14153836873422697.8f264925-a0a6-4c19-9136-fc2fdce30f72.365c42c0-3e87-416c-92c1-dcac7461fffc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32345Akashicgames.MadGunz_7464049jnah78"],"ContentIds":["e35ed5f8-a2e6-b45c-0621-d2e631b8363e","6f91e5db-866e-06ef-679a-1d93aa70468c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mad Gunz is a brilliant pixelated first-person shooter in which you can take arms with a range of cool weapons.

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

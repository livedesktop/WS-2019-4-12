A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudiolay against a friend using the new online multiplayer mode.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French,

Oh, and watch out for the avalanche!\r\n\r\n\"Raaarrooorghh!\" - Yeti\r\n\r\nEscape from forces of nature and team up with friendly animals as you race down the mountain!\r\n\r\n- Will you play as the intrepid Sven or his lovely sister Evana? Will you use skis or a snowboard? Will you ride a snowmobile, a motorbike, or something a little more crazy?\r\n\r\n- Perform tricks and hit the mountain in style! Pull off 360 spins, handstands, snowboard nose-grabs, and strike daring poses - each animal has their own stylish moves!\r\n\r\n- Collect coins to purchase new gear, crazy costumes and powerful vehicles in the shop! Isn't it time you thought about that gold sled you always wanted?\r\n\r\n- Take photos of your epic moments and share them with the world! Set up an amazing photo opportunity and spin the camera around for that perfect shot - all in glorious 3D!\r\n\r\n- Three exciting locations are waiting for you to explore...\r\n\r\nPENGUIN PEAKS\r\n\r\nIt's the snowy slope we loved from Ski Safari, but it's had a Mammoth makeover! Find the frozen Mammoth inside a cave and try to tame him. Or grind across the cables of the after-hours chairlifts. And best of all, grab a snowmobile and pull off epic jumps once more!\r\n\r\nJURASSIC LARK\r\n\r\nIt's about time. A jurassic jungle full of prehistoric pals like the Pterodactyl, the Woolly Mammoth and a baby Ankylosaurus. These ancient animals have a dino-mite plan for our intrepid stars! Race against the \"Lavalanche\", slide along vines, or just go crazy performing tricks as you try to avoid rocks, stalactites and pools of molten lava!\r\n\r\nTWISTER CANYON\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gentle rolling of the tumbleweeds is more your pace. Unfortunately, they didn't call it Twister Canyon for nothing. A fierce twister is headed straight for Sven and Evana! They just can't catch a break, can they?\r\n\r\nHere you'll find an assortment of ragtag rapscallions including Sheriff Yeti, Chief Penguin, and even an Armadillo! Ride in a mine cart, hop on a rickety railway, grind along a telegraph wire or watch the Yeti play the piano! It's how the wild, wild west was meant to be.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ3CN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"PopStar!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15662.9007199266246525.5c150bfb-3c05-444c-822b-11f6b0db05c9.624208b0-6c77-4802-873e-09b31eec8293","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40576.9007199266246525.27074b2a-04cc-49ef-a7d5-f85accd3c2a5.5aca0e2d-aef2-484d-8c81-18f314aee620","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48702.9007199266246525.1e5169fa-b01b-4a30-b210-38ce73c7aa6f.6adcb655-1481-44b4-a38b-8218d7052c12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29519.9007199266246525.162874a2-4f6c-4629-935d-c6799093e1c5.eaa9602f-7d1f-4528-a7b1-3c77b5d0016a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["RuiLueSoftware.5333EC7C5889_kxcx7nefnns9a"],"ContentIds":["409654f5-9e0c-f620-35cb-8f97bd03976a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Original PopStar -- Classic game!

Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

As the rescue mission proceeds, it becomes clear that her involvement in these extraordinary events is no coincidence. \r\n\r\nLila's journey will take her through the mysterious ruins of ancient Egypt, still ruled by the gods of old. Their stories – locked inside chests and engraved in stone – will allow her to uncover a horrifying secret – Dawn has been captured by Seth himself. He's the most dangerous of all the gods, and nobody can stop him from destroying the world. When the last Demon Hunter dies, all hope for mankind will be lost.\r\n\r\nWhat mysteries will Lila bring to light? How is she going to defeat the evil forces? Enter the world of Egyptian gods in this new Demon Hunter adventure.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P5GK7FB1WSS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku Classic!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23075.14573867130554603.1e7f880d-4d81-4e54-8e33-3e71fddcdef3.0691e3f6-1369-49ee-b006-f3b64e014343","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10508.14573867130554603.d5364343-a93e-4d04-a3c8-117918ba4b62.4f0100f2-ac6f-4028-b328-504306fd017e","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["1727Riz.SudokuClassic_yyvbx0pk3r5fr"],"ContentIds":["c2109744-0ab5-072b-a189-3327d46d2191","7a6fee23-f9cd-c0f9-1233-2c0c5ab44373"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Classic Sudoku for beginners and advanced players.
